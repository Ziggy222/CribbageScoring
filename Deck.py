# Deck.py will hold classes and functions related directly to handling Card objects and tracking their movement between locations
# Goal is to keep this generic enough that future card projects can use it whether they use a standard or modified deck of cards

class Card:
    def __init__():
        pass

class Deck:
    def __init__():
        pass
    
    # Removes and Returns the top card_count cards of the deck, defaulting to 1
    def draw(card_count=1):
        pass

    # Returns the top card_count cards of the deck, defaulting to 1, does not remove those cards
    def peek(card_count=1):
        pass
